#  Imbue

Color picker with wide color support. For iOS.

## Frameworks

- [Shohin](http://github.com/RoyalIcing/Shohin), a declarative view assistant library inspired by Elm and React. Imbue helps drives improvements to Shohin.

## Lab

Lab is a color space with a wider gamut than sRGB, which make it great for the ‘wide color’ displays in iPhone 8+ and iPad Pro.

- L: lightness
- a: green–red
- b: blue–yellow

Wikipedia has a [great article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) that explains the benefits of Lab:

> CIELAB was designed to be perceptually uniform with respect to human color vision, meaning that the same amount of numerical change in these values corresponds to about the same amount of visually perceived change.

> [Lab] can be used to make accurate color balance corrections by modifying output curves in the a and b components, or to adjust the lightness contrast using the L component. In RGB or CMYK spaces, which model the output of physical devices rather than human visual perception, these transformations can be done only with the help of appropriate blend modes in the editing application.

## Color contrasts

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the standard that makes the web more accessible.
